# Fake News Detection: An Overview

## Definitions of Fake News and Related Concepts

The proliferation of **fake news** poses a significant challenge in modern societies [1]. The term encompasses various forms of information disorder, often overlapping with concepts like deceptive news, disinformation, and misinformation [2].

Definitional chaos: There's no universal definition of "fake news" because it encompasses many phenomena (misinformation, disinformation, malinformation) with different intents, formats, and severities.
Taxonomical fragmentation: Different researchers focus on different aspects (content, source, spread patterns, intent), creating overlapping taxonomies rather than a unified framework.
System classification confusion: Detection systems vary by methodology (AI/ML, crowd-sourcing, expert verification), features analyzed (linguistic, network, user behavior), and objectives (early detection vs. deep verification).
Market immaturity: Despite academic research, commercial products are limited by technical challenges, platform-specific constraints, and the evolving nature of misinformation.

Wardle and Derakhshan advocate for using more specific terms under the umbrella of "**information disorder**" rather than relying solely on "fake news" [3].

| Type of Mis/Disinformation | Description | Threat Level | Detection Needs |
|----------------------------|-------------|--------------|-----------------|
| Satire/Parody | Content with no intention to harm but potential to fool | Low | Context recognition, source verification |
| Misleading Content | Misleading use of information to frame issues or individuals | Medium | Fact verification, source tracking |
| Imposter Content | Impersonation of genuine sources | High | Authentication systems, digital signatures |
| Fabricated Content | Content that is 100% false, designed to deceive | High | Cross-reference verification, comprehensive fact-checking |
| False Connection | Headlines, visuals or captions that don't support content | Medium | Content-headline consistency checks |
| False Context | Genuine content shared with false contextual information | High | Temporal analysis, context verification |
| Manipulated Content | Genuine information or imagery manipulated to deceive | Critical | Digital forensics, content authentication |

## How Can We Detect Fake News? Categorisation of Methods

Researchers have developed various methods to automatically identify fake news. These can be broadly categorised based on the information they utilise [2, 9]:

*   **Content-based Methods:** These methods analyse the **news article itself**, looking at the text, images, and sometimes even videos [2, 9, 10].
    *   **Stylistic Analysis:** Examining the **writing style**, such as vocabulary, grammar, sentiment [10], and linguistic patterns [11], to see if they differ between fake and real news [9]. For example, fake news might use more emotional language or clickbait headlines [8]. This can involve analysing features at the lexical, syntactic, discourse, and semantic levels [10].
    *   **Knowledge-based Fact-checking:** Comparing the **claims made in the news with external knowledge sources** like **knowledge bases (KBs) or knowledge graphs (KGs)** (e.g., YAGO [12], Freebase [13], NELL [14], DBpedia [15]) or **fact-checking websites** (e.g., PolitiFact [16], GossipCop [17]) to verify their accuracy [9, 10, 18]. This involves knowledge extraction and comparison [19].
    *   **Semantic Analysis:** Using techniques like **word embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe, BERT)** [10, 20, 21] and topic modelling (e.g., LDA [8, 22]) to understand the meaning and context of the text [8, 10, 20]. Contextualized word embeddings like **BERT** [20, 21, 23] have shown significant results [23].
    *   **Multi-modal Analysis:** Analysing **multiple types of content together**, such as text and images [20, 24, 25], to find inconsistencies or patterns indicative of fake news [20]. Deep learning models like **CNNs** for images and **RNNs or Transformers** for text are often used [20, 21]. Datasets like Media-Weibo include multiple modalities [25, 26].

*   **Propagation-based Methods:** These methods focus on **how fake news spreads through social networks** [9, 10, 27].
    *   Analysing the **network of users** who share the news, looking for patterns like rapid or widespread dissemination by suspicious accounts (e.g., bots) [5, 10, 27].
    *   Studying the **temporal patterns** of how the news spreads over time [10]. Features like repost time can be considered [28].
    *   Using **graph-based models (GNNs)** [8, 21, 29] to represent the propagation network and learn patterns associated with fake news [21]. Techniques like modelling the news dissemination process as a tree structure have been explored [30].

*   **Source-based Methods:** These methods evaluate the **credibility of the source** that published or shared the news [9, 10, 31].
    *   Assessing the **reputation of the news website or social media account** based on its history and fact-checking reports [32]. Web spam detection techniques can be relevant here [33].
    *   Analysing the **characteristics of the authors or publishers**, if available [34]. Co-authorship networks can be examined [35].
    *   Considering the **social media users** who are sharing the news, with the idea that less credible users might be more likely to spread fake news [32].

*   **Stance-based Methods:** These approaches try to understand the **opinions or stances of users** towards a particular news item [8, 29], as this can provide clues about its veracity [8]. Analysing comments and reactions can reveal whether people generally believe or disbelieve the news [29].

## Taxonomy of Detection Methods

Fake news detection methods can be categorised based on several criteria [1, 2]:

1.  **Type of features used** (e.g., textual, social, visual).
2.  **Fake news detection perspectives** (e.g., content-based, social context-based, knowledge-based).
3.  **Feature representation methods** (e.g., count-based, embeddings, transformer models). Figure 6 in [1] illustrates a taxonomy of text representation methods.
4.  **Classification approaches** (e.g., traditional machine learning, deep learning).
