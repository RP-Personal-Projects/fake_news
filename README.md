This mind map provides a structured overview of the broad methods used in fake news detection, drawing from the information in the provided sources and our previous conversation.



Zhou et al. [5] categorize current techniques into knowledge-based methods, style-based approaches, propagation-based algorithms and credibility-based networks. 

Zhang et al. [46] review the fake news detection mechanisms corresponding to three types of features of fake news, such as creator/user-based, news content-based and social context-based features.

This paper

- Intentional creation
  Unlike real news that reports real events, fake news is usually created with intention
- Heteromorphic transmission
  Real news is usually spread by ordinary users, while fake news however tends to be propagated by diverse types of users, which thereby results in heteromorphic transmission patterns. For example, as pointed out by Ma et al. [26], fake news is typically posted by a low-impact user first and then widely spread by opinion leaders, while real news is usually initiated by an opinion leader and spread by normal users.
- Controversial reception
People are more likely to hold different views towards fake news than real news. 


Given this techniques are characterised into:
- intentional feature based
- propagation based
- stance bases


Types of disinformation

| Information Type | Authenticity    | Intention                   |
|:----------------|:----------------|:----------------------------|
| Fake News       | Verified False  | Intentionally Deceptive     |
| Misinformation  | False           | Not Intentionally Deceptive |
| Rumor           | Unverified      | Unknown Intention           |

As shown in Table 1, intentional features of fake news can be categorized into four types: misleading the public, manipulating opinions, attracting user attention and other general features.

The Ambiguity Problem

Definitional chaos: There's no universal definition of "fake news" because it encompasses many phenomena (misinformation, disinformation, malinformation) with different intents, formats, and severities.
Taxonomical fragmentation: Different researchers focus on different aspects (content, source, spread patterns, intent), creating overlapping taxonomies rather than a unified framework.
System classification confusion: Detection systems vary by methodology (AI/ML, crowd-sourcing, expert verification), features analyzed (linguistic, network, user behavior), and objectives (early detection vs. deep verification).
Market immaturity: Despite academic research, commercial products are limited by technical challenges, platform-specific constraints, and the evolving nature of misinformation.

# Fake News Identification: A Beginner's Guide

Welcome to this repository! This guide provides an introduction to the fascinating and crucial field of fake news identification. Whether you're a curious learner or looking to start your own projects, this is the place to begin.

## What Exactly is Fake News?

Understanding what we mean by "fake news" is the first step. It's more nuanced than simply "false information". According to the research:

*   **Broad Definition:** "**Fake news is false news**". This definition focuses solely on the inaccuracy of the information.
*   **Narrow Definition (adopted for research):** "**Fake news is a news article that is intentionally and verifiably false**". This definition is more specific, highlighting both the **falsity** of the news and the **intention to deceive**.

It's important to distinguish fake news from related concepts:

*   **Misinformation:** False information that may be spread without malicious intent.
*   **Disinformation:** False information that is intentionally created and spread to deceive. **Fake news is often considered a type of disinformation**.
*   **Satire:** News that uses humour and irony to comment on current events, not intended to mislead.
*   **Rumours:** Unverified information that may or may not be true and lacks clear intent.
*   **Hoaxes:** Intentional deceptions, often for entertainment or fraud, not necessarily presented as news.
*   **Clickbait:** Content designed to attract clicks, often with misleading headlines.

## How Can We Detect Fake News? Categorisation of Methods

Researchers have developed various methods to automatically identify fake news. These can be broadly categorised based on the information they utilise:

*   **Content-based Methods:** These methods analyse the **news article itself**, looking at the text, images, and sometimes even videos.
    *   **Stylistic Analysis:** Examining the **writing style**, such as vocabulary, grammar, sentiment, and linguistic patterns, to see if they differ between fake and real news. For example, fake news might use more emotional language or clickbait headlines.
    *   **Knowledge-based Fact-checking:** Comparing the **claims made in the news with external knowledge sources** like knowledge bases (e.g., Wikipedia, DBpedia) or fact-checking websites (e.g., PolitiFact, GossipCop) to verify their accuracy.
    *   **Semantic Analysis:** Using techniques like **word embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe, BERT)** and topic modelling to understand the meaning and context of the text.
    *   **Multi-modal Analysis:** Analysing **multiple types of content together**, such as text and images, to find inconsistencies or patterns indicative of fake news. Deep learning models like CNNs for images and RNNs or Transformers for text are often used.

*   **Propagation-based Methods:** These methods focus on **how fake news spreads through social networks**.
    *   Analysing the **network of users** who share the news, looking for patterns like rapid or widespread dissemination by suspicious accounts (e.g., bots).
    *   Studying the **temporal patterns** of how the news spreads over time.
    *   Using **graph-based models (GNNs)** to represent the propagation network and learn patterns associated with fake news.

*   **Source-based Methods:** These methods evaluate the **credibility of the source** that published or shared the news.
    *   Assessing the **reputation of the news website or social media account** based on its history and fact-checking reports.
    *   Analysing the **characteristics of the authors or publishers**, if available.
    *   Considering the **social media users** who are sharing the news, with the idea that less credible users might be more likely to spread fake news.

*   **Stance-based Methods:** These approaches try to understand the **opinions or stances of users** towards a particular news item, as this can provide clues about its veracity. Analysing comments and reactions can reveal whether people generally believe or disbelieve the news.

## Current State-of-the-Art (SOTA)

The field of fake news detection is constantly evolving, with **deep learning techniques** currently achieving state-of-the-art performance across various tasks. Some key trends include:

*   **Transformer Models:** Models like **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)** and its variants have shown **superior performance** in understanding the context and nuances of text. They are often used for feature extraction from news content and can be fine-tuned for fake news classification.
*   **Multi-modal Approaches:** Combining information from different modalities (text, image, video) using deep learning architectures is a significant area of progress. Models that can effectively fuse these different types of information tend to perform better.
*   **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs):** GNNs are increasingly used to model the **social context and propagation patterns** of fake news, capturing relationships between users and news items.
*   **Attention Mechanisms:** These mechanisms allow models to **focus on the most relevant parts of the input data** (e.g., specific words or phrases in a news article, key users in a propagation network), improving their ability to identify subtle cues of fake news.
*   **Transfer Learning:** Using models pre-trained on large amounts of text data (like BERT) and then fine-tuning them on smaller fake news datasets has proven very effective, especially for languages with limited labelled data.
*   **Explainable Fake News Detection:** There is a growing interest in developing models that not only detect fake news accurately but also provide **explanations** for their predictions, for example, by highlighting the parts of the text or the patterns in the spread that led to the classification.

## Code

This repository may contain code examples demonstrating basic fake news identification techniques. Keep an eye out for folders containing scripts and notebooks. These will often utilise popular libraries for natural language processing (like NLTK, spaCy, Transformers) and machine learning (like scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch).

**Note:** The optimal techniques often depend on the specific dataset and the types of fake news being targeted. Context-dependent models, especially those based on transformer architectures, generally show strong results.

We hope this introduction has been helpful! Feel free to explore the resources and code in this repository to learn more about the fascinating challenge of fake news identification.
